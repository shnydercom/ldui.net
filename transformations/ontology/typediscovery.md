# This file is used to collect potentially interesting Linked Data types
- `owl:cardinality`

# inspiration for this ontology
- https://www.w3.org/ns/ui#
- https://schema.org/PropertyValueSpecification

# design goals
- find a way to "cache" a web-ontology for on-premise projects
- find ways to let the ontology be useful: intellisense for IDEs, similar approach for other tools
- treat the current version as WIP, reach a stable version
- link to stable web-ontologies in the stable version of this ontology
